I'm an application engineer at [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/) specializing in LS-DYNA explicit analysis. I spend most of my working time scaling LS-DYNA simulations for parameterized workflows, though I also support Structured-ALE and Workbench-DYNA efforts.

My github use focuses on [PyDYNA](https://github.com/ansys/pydyna), [PyDPF](https://github.com/ansys/pydpf-core), and a number of personal projects that never live longer than a week.

Coding languages:
- Python
- MATLAB
- C (I hate it)
- Bash
